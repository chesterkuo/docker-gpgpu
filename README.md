This is a docker container image project for AMD APU/GPU and other devices support OpenCL function.
I'm working on the plan to have docker/swarm support to put/schedule your application across HPC cluster on OpenCL/CUDA node.

Will focus on OpenCL first since it supported by Intel, AMD, AMD and Nvidia.
